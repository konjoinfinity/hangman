# Konjo Hangman

## Welcome to the Konjo Hangman Game!

#### To play:

Enter a word or phrase into the form using the your device keyboard. Press enter
to create the word board and start guessing using the letter buttons at the
bottom of the screen. When a correct letter is chosen, the word board is updated
with the corresponding letter guessed. If an incorrect letter is chosen, the
hangman image is changed. Don't guess more than 7 incorrect letters, otherwise
hangman will swing... If all correct letters are chosen you win!
