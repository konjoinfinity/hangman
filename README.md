Konjo Hangman

Welcome to the Konjo Hangman Game!

To play: Enter a word into the form using the your device keyboard. Click the
Enter Word button to create the word board and start guessing using the letter
buttons at the bottom of the screen. When a correct letter is chosen, the
word board is updated with the corresponding letter guessed. If an incorrect
letter is chosen, the hangman image is changed. Don't guess more than 7 incorrect
letters, otherwise hangman will swing... If all correct letters are chosen you
win!

Additional documentation and sourcing of code can be seen inline in each of the
.html, .css, and .js files.
